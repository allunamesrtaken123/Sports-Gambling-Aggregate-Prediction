```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = T)

library(readr)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r Import Data, message = F}
d <- read_csv("/Users/aaronfoote/Downloads/spreadspoke_scores.csv")
```
This dataset doesn't have the necessary info. I need money lines.
```{r Getting Familiar + Cleaning}
d %>% filter(!is.na(team_favorite_id)) ->d
regularSeason <- d %>% filter(!schedule_playoff)
playoffs <- d %>% filter(schedule_playoff)
```
