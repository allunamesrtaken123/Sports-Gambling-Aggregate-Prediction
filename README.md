# Sports-Gambling-Aggregate-Prediction

For this project, Evan and I are trying to recreate the results of a paper that devised and implemented a successful sports gambling strategy.
Our first step is to recreate their results, then deploy our own model, and finally build up a system to make the gambling more successful
by implementing strategies to subvert the exclusionary practices that sportsbooks use against winning customers.
