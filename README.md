# Sports-Gambling-Aggregate-Prediction

For this project, Evan and I are trying to recreate the results of a paper that devised and implemented a successful sports gambling strategy.
Our first step is to recreate their results, then deploy our own model, and finally build up a system to make the gambling more successful
by implementing strategies to subvert the exclusionary practices that sportsbooks use against winning customers.

## Progress After Commit on 8/15/23:
The file scrapingBetMonitor.py is now capable of scraping betmonitor.com to get the odds from a bunch of sportsbooks, for a bunch of games. Some very basic stats are calculated and then written to file. 

Some Ideas on Next Steps:

* Identify arbs and write those to a different file
* Implement the aggregation-bullying algorithm
